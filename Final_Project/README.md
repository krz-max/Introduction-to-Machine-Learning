# [NYCU 2022 Fall] Introduction to Machine Learning - Final Project

This repository is the official implementation of [Tabular Playground Series - Aug 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-aug-2022/overview). on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## Requirements
Requirements are documented in the first section of code in the file `Final_Train.ipynb`

## Training

To train the model(s), download the notebook and simply press the `run all` command

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on Kaggle:
1. After the `Training` process or `Inference` process, there should be a new file `submission.csv`
2. Upload the `submission.csv` to the Kaggle playground, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-aug-2022/overview) to access the website.
3. Click `Late Submission` to upload the `csv` file.
4. And we're done ! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

## Pre-trained Models

* You can download pretrained models in this repository [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cnXAgGk6cMVc0HvN3ZOmyraj9tD7TSfW?usp=sharing)
* or simply use the `Model0.sav` in this GitHub repository

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :
### [Tabular Playground Series - Aug 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-aug-2022/submissions)


| Model name         | Private Score  | Public Score |
